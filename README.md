# ðŸ“ˆ Volume Control with Hand Gestures

Welcome to the **Volume Control with Hand Gestures** project! This innovative project leverages machine learning and computer vision to control your PC's volume using simple hand gestures. With this solution, you can adjust the volume by simply giving a thumbs up or thumbs down.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects thumbs up and thumbs down gestures to control volume.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Processes webcam feed in real-time to adjust volume.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a deep learning model trained on labeled image data.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works directly with your PC's volume controls.

---

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Flask**: For creating a simple web interface for file uploads.
- **TensorFlow**: Used to build and train the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: Handles real-time image processing.
- **scikit-learn**: For splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **PyCaw**: Manages audio volume control on Windows.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volume-control.git
   cd volume-control

2. **Clone the repository and set up the virtual environment:**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volume-control.git
   cd volume-control

   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pip` installed and then run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate

5. **Set Up Your Data:**

   Ensure you have a CSV file with image paths and labels for training the model. Place it in the `data/` directory and update the file path in `main.py` to point to your CSV file.

6. **Run the Application**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python app.py

7. **Train the Model**

   Make sure you have a valid CSV file for training the model. Place it in the `data/` directory and update the file path in `main.py` accordingly.

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py

8. **Run Volume Control**

   Run the volume control script:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python volume.py
